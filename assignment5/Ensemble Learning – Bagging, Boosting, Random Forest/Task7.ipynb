    "\n",
    "- Random Forest uses bagging and feature randomness. By training many decision trees on bootstrapped samples and averaging their predictions, it smooths out fluctuations and reduces overfitting caused by high variance in individual trees."

    "- Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, since it focuses heavily on correcting previous mistakes. This can lead to overfitting, especially if the model is too complex or trained for too many iterations."
